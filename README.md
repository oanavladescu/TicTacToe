# TicTacToe

A tic tac toe game developed using Angular 8, TypeScript, SCSS, HTML and Nebular (cosmic theme). I used Angular to render board and squares components. This game is in single player mode.

## Application's UI:

The game begins with an empty board, displaying current player:

If one player wins, the message on top is replaced with an adequate message:

If there are no moves available, the "It's a Tie" message is returned:

Clicking the "restart" button you will get a new empty board, for never ending fun.
